# Genmoji - Apple GenMoji Recreation

A project to recreate Apple's GenMoji functionality by fine-tuning image generation models to create emoji-style images from text descriptions.

## Overview

This project aims to fine-tune image generation models to create Apple-style emojis from text prompts like "flying pig". The models will be quantized to run efficiently on mobile devices.

## Project Roadmap

1. **Data Collection**
   - Scrape emoji PNGs and descriptions from emojigraph.org
   - Process images to add white backgrounds (similar to Apple's approach)

2. **Model Development**
   - Fine-tune separate image generation models for different skin tones and person types
   - Quantize models for mobile deployment
   - Implement LLM for prompt engineering and enhancement

3. **Applications**
   - Build Gradio web interface for testing
   - Develop iOS application (planned)
